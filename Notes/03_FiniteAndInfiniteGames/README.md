# The Golden Qoutes:


- death in life is a misfortune, the resigned acceptance of a loser’s status, a refusal to hold any title up for recognition.

- He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life

- Death is not, therefore, chosen, but inflicted. It happens to one when the struggle against it fails. Death comes as a judgment, a dishonor, a sign of certain weakness.

- If I accept death as inevitable, I do not struggle against mortality. I struggle as a mortal.

- Power refers to the freedom persons have within limits, strength to the freedom persons have with limits.

- Evil is not the attempt to eliminate the play of another according to published and accepted rules, but to eliminate the play of another regardless of the rules. Evil is not the acquisition of power, but the expression of power. It is the forced recognition of a title—and therein lies the contradiction of evil, for recognition cannot be forced. The Nazis did not compete with the Jews for a title, but demanded recognition of a title without competition. This could be achieved, however, only by silencing the Jews, only by hearing nothing from them. They were to die in silence, along with their culture, without anyone noticing, not even those who managed the institutions and instruments of death.


- Evil arises in the honored belief that history can be tidied up, brought to a sensible conclusion. It is evil to act as though the past is bringing us to a specifiable end. It is evil to assume that the past will make sense only if we bring it to an issue we have clearly in view. It is evil for a nation to believe it is “the last, best hope on earth.” It is evil to think history is to end with a return to Zion, or with the classless society, or with the Islamicization of all living infidels.


- Infinite players understand the inescapable likelihood of evil. Theytherefore do not attempt to eliminate evil in others, for to do so is the very impulse of evil itself, and therefore a contradiction. They only attempt paradoxically to recognize in themselves the evil that takes the form of attempting to eliminate evil elsewhere.


- One cannot be human by oneself.
There is no selfhood where there is no community. We do not relate to
others as the persons we are; we are who we are in relating to others.


- Society and culture are therefore not true opponents of each other.
Rather society is a species of culture that persists in contradicting itself,
a freely organized attempt to conceal the freedom of the organizers and
the organized, an attempt to forget that we have willfully forgotten our
decision to enter this or that contest and to continue in it.


- Heroes of lost battles are almost never memorialized. :(

- It is therefore essential to the effectiveness of every title that it be
visible and that in its visibility it point back at the contest in which it
was won. The purpose of property is to make our titles visible. Property
is emblematic. It recalls to others those areas in which our victories are
beyond challenge.

- We do not proceed through a traffic intersection
because the signal changes, but when the signal changes.


- The theatricality of property has, in fact, an elaborate structure that
property owners must be at considerable labor to sustain. If property is
to be persuasively emblematic, that is, if it is to draw attention to the
owner’s titles in past victories, a double burden falls on its owners:
First, they must show that the amount of their property corresponds
to the difficulty they were under in winning title to it. Property must be
seen as compensation.
Second, they must show that the type of their property corresponds
to the nature of the competition by which title to it was won. Property
must be seen to be consumed.


- After athletic contests in which major titles have been at stake, it
is common for the audience to lift the winners to their shoulders,
marching them about as if they were helpless—in the sharpest possible
contrast to the physical skill and energy they have just displayed.


- If wealth and might are to be performed, great wealth and great
might must be performed brilliantly.


- The deepest and most consequent struggle of each society is therefore
not with other societies, but with the culture that exists within itself—
the culture that is itself


- Conflict with other societies is, in fact, an
effective way for a society to restrain its own culture


- This is why patriotism—that is, the desire to protect the power in a
society by way of increasing the power of a society—is inherently
belligerent. Since there can be no prizes without a society, no society
without opponents, patriots must create enemies before we can require
protection from them. Patriots can flourish only where boundaries are
well-defined, hostile, and dangerous. The spirit of patriotism is therefore
characteristically associated with the military or other modes of
international conflict.


- Because patriotism is the desire to contain all other finite games
within itself—that is, to embrace all horizons within a single boundary
—it is inherently evil.


- We are never somewhere in relation to the horizon since the horizon
moves with our vision. We can only be somewhere by turning away from
the horizon, by replacing vision with opposition, by declaring the place
on which we stand to be timeless—a sacred region, a holy land, a body
of truth, a code of inviolable commandments. To be somewhere is to
absolutize time, space, and number.


- Any culture that continues to influence our vision
continues to grow in the very exercise of that influence


- A people, as a people, has nothing to defend. In the same way a
people has nothing and no one to attack. One cannot be free by
opposing another. My freedom does not depend on your loss of
freedom. On the contrary, since freedom is never freedom from society,
but freedom for it, my freedom inherently affirms yours.
A people has no enemies.


- Finite players
go to war against states because they endanger boundaries; infinite
players oppose states because they engender boundaries.


- The strategy of finite players is to kill a state by killing the people
who invented it. Infinite players, however, understanding war to be a
conflict between states, conclude that states can have only states as
enemies; they cannot have persons as enemies. “Sometimes it is possible
to kill a state without killing a single one of its members; and war gives
no right which is not necessary to the gaining of its object”


- For infinite players the chief difficulty with finite players’
commitment to war is not, however, that persons are killed. Indeed,
finite players themselves often genuinely regret this and do as little
killing as possible. The difficulty is that such warfare has in it the
contradiction of all finite play. Winning a war can be as destructive as
losing one, for if boundaries lose their clarity, as they do in a decisive
victory, the state loses its identity


- Plato suggested that some of the poets be driven out of the Republic
because they had the power to weaken the guardians. Poets can make it
impossible to have a war—unless they tell stories that agree with the
“general line” established by the state. Poets who have no metaphysics,
and therefore no political line, make war impossible because they have
the irresistible ability to show the guardians that what seems necessary
is only possible.


- Metaphysics is about the real but is abstract. Poetry is the making
(poiesis) of the real and is concrete. Whenever what is made (poiema) is
separated from the maker (poietes), it becomes metaphysical. As it
stands there, and as the voice of the poietes is no longer listened to, the
poiema is an object to be studied, not an act to be learned. One cannot
learn an object, but only the poiesis, or the act of creating objects. To
separate the poiema from poiesis, the created object from the creative
act, is the essence of the theatrical.
