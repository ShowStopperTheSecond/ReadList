# Interesting qoutes:

-  A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play.

-  It is an invariable principle of all play, finite and infinite, that whoever plays, plays freely. Whoever must play, cannot play.

-  It is the case that we cannot play if we must play, but it is also the case that we cannot play alone. Thus, in every case, we must find an opponent, and in most cases teammates, who are willing to join in play with us.

-  Because finite players cannot select themselves for play, there is never a time when they cannot be removed from the game, or when the other contestants cannot refuse to play with them.


-  The world is elaborately marked by boundaries of contest, its people finely classified as to their eligibilities.

-  In one respect, but only one, an infinite game is identical to a finite game: Of infinite players we can also say that if they play they play freely; if they must play, they cannot play.

-  Finite games can be played within an infinite game, but an infinite game cannot be played within a finite game. Infinite players regard their wins and losses in whatever finite games they play as but moments in continuing play.

-  If finite games must be externally bounded by time, space, and number, they must also have internal limitations on what the players can do to and with each other. To agree on internal limitations is to establish rules of play.
 
-  The agreement of the players to the applicable rules constitutes the ultimate validation of those rules.

-  Rules are not valid because the Senate passed them, or because heroes once played by them, or because God pronounced them through Moses or Muhammad. They are valid only if and when players freely play by them.

-  There are no rules that require us to obey rules. If there were, there would have to be a rule for those rules, and so on.

-  If the rules of a finite game are unique to that game it is evident that the rules may not change in the course of play—else a different game is being played. It is on this point that we find the most critical distinction between finite and infinite play: The rules of an infinite game must change in the course of play.The rules are changed when the players of an infinite game agree that the play is imperiled by a finite outcome—that is, by the victory of some players and the defeat of others.

-  The rules of an infinite game are changed to prevent anyone from winning the game and to bring as many persons as possible into the play.

-  If the rules of a finite game are the contractual terms by which the players can agree who has won, the rules of an infinite game are the contractual terms by which the players agree to continue playing.

-  The rule- making capacity of infinite players is often challenged by the impingement of powerful boundaries against their play—such as physical exhaustion, or the loss of material resources, or the hostility of nonplayers, or death.

-  The task is to design rules that will allow the players to continue the game by taking these limits into play—even when death is one of the limits. It is in this sense that the game is infinite.

-  Although it may be evident enough in theory that whoever plays a finite game plays freely, it is often the case that finite players will be unaware of this absolute freedom and will come to think that whatever they do they must do

-  Some self- veiling is present in all finite games. Players must intentionally forget the inherently voluntary nature of their play, else all competitive effort will desert them.

-  Dramatically, one chooses to be a mother; theatrically, one takes on the role of mother.

-  One obeys the rules in a finite game in order to play, but playing does not consist only in obeying rules.


-  A finite player is trained not only to anticipate every future possibility, but to control the future, to prevent it from altering the past.

-  Since finite games can be played within an infinite game, infinite players do not eschew the performed roles of finite play. On the contrary, they enter into finite games with all the appropriate energy and self- veiling, but they do so without the seriousness of finite players.

-  Surprise is a crucial element in most finite games. If we are not prepared to meet each of the possible moves of an opponent, our chances of losing are most certainly increased. It is therefore by surprising our opponent that we are most likely to win. Surprise in finite play is the triumph of the past over the future.

-  To be prepared against surprise is to be trained. To be prepared for surprise is to be educated.


-  The infinite player does not expect only to be amused by surprise, but to
be transformed by it, for surprise does not alter some abstract past, but
one’s own personal past.

- Education discovers an increasing richness in the past, because it sees
what is unfinished there. Training regards the past as finished and the
future as to be finished. Education leads toward a continuing self- 
discovery; training leads toward a final self- definition.

- Training repeats a completed past in the future. Education continues
an unfinished past into the future.

- What one wins in a finite game is a title.
A title is the acknowledgment of others that one has been the winner of
a particular game.


- Since titles are timeless, but exist only so far as they are
acknowledged, we must find means to guarantee the memory of them.
The birettas of dead cardinals are suspended from the ceilings of
cathedrals, as it were forever; the numbers of great athletes are “retired”
or withdrawn from all further play; great achievements are carved in
imperishable stone or memorialized by perpetual flames.

- Some titles are inherited, though only when the bloodline or some
other tangible connection with the original winner has been established,
suggesting that the winners have continued to exist in their descendants.


- Death in life is a mode of existence in which one has ceased all play;
there is no further striving for titles. All competitive engagement with
others has been abandoned. For some, though not for all, death in life is
a misfortune, the resigned acceptance of a loser’s status, a refusal to
hold any title up for recognition. For others, however, death in life can
be regarded as an achievement, the result of a spiritual discipline, say,
intended to extinguish all traces of struggle with the world, a liberation
from the need for any title whatsoever. “Die before ye die,” declare the
Sufi mystics.

- Life in death concerns those who are titled and whose titles, since
they are timeless, may not be extinguished by death. Immortality, in this
case, is not a reward but the condition necessary to the possession of
rewards. Victors live forever not because their souls are unaffected by
death but because their titles must not be forgotten.

- Soldiers commonly achieve a life in death. Soldiers fight not to stay
alive but to save the nation. Those who do fight only to protect
themselves are, in fact, considered guilty of the highest military crimes.
Soldiers who die fighting the enemy, however, receive the nation’s
highest reward: They are declared unforgettable. Even unknown soldiers
are memorialized—though their names have been lost, their titles will
not be.

- What the winners of finite games achieve is not properly an afterlife
but an afterworld, not continuing existence but continuing recognition
of their titles.

- A slave can have life only by giving it away. “He who loves his life
loses it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal
life” (Jesus).

-  Death is not, therefore, chosen, but inflicted. It happens to one when the struggle against it fails. Death comes as a judgment, a dishonor, a sign of certain weakness.
 


- If the losers are dead, the dead are also losers.

- Death, for finite players, is abstract, not concrete. It is not the whole
person, but only an abstracted fragment of the whole, that dies in life or
lives in death.
So also is life abstract for finite players. It is not the whole person
who lives. If life is a means to life, we must abstract ourselves, but only
for the sake of winning an abstraction.


- Immortality is therefore the supreme example of the
contradictoriness of finite play: It is a life one cannot live.

- The death of an infinite player is dramatic. It does not mean that the
game comes to an end with death; on the contrary, infinite players offer
their death as a way of continuing the play.


- Infinite players play best when they become least necessary to the
continuation of play. It is for this reason they play as mortals.

- The joyfulness of infinite play, its laughter, lies in learning to start
something we cannot finish.

- Names, like titles, are given. Persons cannot name themselves any
more than they can entitle themselves. However, unlike titles, which are
given for what a person has done, a name is given at birth—at a time
when a person cannot yet have done anything. Titles are given at the
end of play, names at the beginning.

- When a person is known by title, the attention is on a completed
past, on a game already concluded, and not therefore to be played
again. A title effectively takes a person out of play.

- When a person is known only by name, the attention of others is on
an open future. We simply cannot know what to expect. Whenever we
address each other by name we ignore all scripts, and open the
possibility that our relationship will become deeply reciprocal. That I
cannot now predict your future is exactly what makes mine
unpredictable.

- Titles, then, point backward in time. They have their origin in an
unrepeatable past.


- The mode and content of address and the manner of behavior are
recognitions of the areas in which titled persons are no longer in
competition. There are precise ways in which one may no longer
compete with the Dalai Lama or the Heavyweight Champion of the
World. There is no possible action by which one may deprive them of
their titles to contests now in the past. Therefore, insofar as we
recognize their titles we withdraw from any contest with them in those
areas.

- The titled are powerful. Those around them are expected to yield, to
withdraw their opposition, and to conform to their will—in the arena in
which the title was won.

- The exercise of power also presupposes a closed field and finite units
of time. My power is determined by the amount of resistance I can
displace within given spatial and temporal limits.

- To speak meaningfully of a person’s power is to speak of what that
person has already completed in one or another closed field. To see
power is to look backward in time.


- Inasmuch as power is determined by the outcome of a game, one
does not win by being powerful; one wins to be powerful. If one has
sufficient power to win before the game has begun, what follows is not a
game at all.


- Power is bestowed by an audience after the play is complete.


- It seems plainly false to say that power is theatrical.
And yet, the theatrical nature of power seems to be consistent with
the principle arrived at earlier: Whoever must play cannot play. The
intuitive idea in that principle is that no one can engage us competitively
unless we fully cooperate, unless we join the game and join it to win.
Because power is measurable only in comparative—that is, competitive
—terms, it presupposes some kind of cooperation. If we defer to titled
winners, it is only because we regard ourselves as losers. To do so is
freely to take part in the theater of power.


- If I accept death as inevitable, I do not struggle against mortality. I
struggle as a mortal.

- Infinite players do not oppose the actions of others, but initiate actions of their
own in such a way that others will respond by initiating their own.

- A powerful person is one who brings the past to an outcome, settling
all its unresolved issues. A strong person is one who carries the past into
the future, showing that none of its issues is capable of resolution.


- Strength is paradoxical. I am not strong because I can force others to
do what I wish as a result of my play with them, but because I can allow
them to do what they wish in the course of my play with them.

- Power refers to
the freedom persons have within limits, strength to the freedom persons
have with limits.

- Evil is the termination of infinite play. It is infinite play coming to an end in unheard silence.

- Unheard silence does not necessarily mean the death of the player.
Unheard silence is not the loss of the player’s voice, but the loss of
listeners for that voice. It is an evil when the drama of a life does not
continue in others for reason of their deafness or ignorance.

- There are silences that can be heard, even from the dead and from
the severely oppressed. Much is recoverable from an apparently
forgotten past. Sensitive and faithful historians can learn much of what
has been lost, and much therefore that can be continued.

- Evil is not the attempt to eliminate the play of another according to
published and accepted rules, but to eliminate the play of another
regardless of the rules. Evil is not the acquisition of power, but the
expression of power. It is the forced recognition of a title—and therein
lies the contradiction of evil, for recognition cannot be forced. The
Nazis did not compete with the Jews for a title, but demanded
recognition of a title without competition. This could be achieved,
however, only by silencing the Jews, only by hearing nothing from them.
They were to die in silence, along with their culture, without anyone
noticing, not even those who managed the institutions and instruments
of death.


- Evil arises in the honored belief that history can be tidied up, brought to a sensible conclusion. It is evil to act as though the past is bringing us to a specifiable end. It is evil to assume that the past will make sense only if we bring it to an issue we have clearly in view. It is evil for a nation to believe it is “the last, best hope on earth.” It is evil to think history is to end with a return to Zion, or with the classless society, or with the Islamicization of all living infidels.


- Infinite players understand the inescapable likelihood of evil. They
therefore do not attempt to eliminate evil in others, for to do so is the
very impulse of evil itself, and therefore a contradiction. They only
attempt paradoxically to recognize in themselves the evil that takes the
form of attempting to eliminate evil elsewhere.


- One cannot be human by oneself.


- We do not relate to others as the persons we are; we are who we are in relating to others.

- Only that which can change can continue: this is the principle by which infinite
players live.

- Theycan see that the dream of freedom is universal, that wars are fought to
win it, heroes die to protect it, and songs are written to commemorate
its attainment.

- If we think of society as all that a people does under the veil of
necessity, we must also think of it as a single finite game that includes
any number of smaller games within its boundaries.

- Like a finite game, a society is numerically, spatially, and temporally
limited. Its citizenship is precisely defined, its boundaries are inviolable,
and its past is enshrined.

- It is in the interest of a society therefore to encourage
competition within itself, to establish the largest possible number of
prizes, for the holders of prizes will be those most likely to defend the
society as a whole against its competitors.

- Culture, on the other hand, is an infinite game. Culture has no
boundaries. Anyone can be a participant in a culture—anywhere and at
any time.


- Because culture as such can have no temporal limits, a culture
understands its past not as destiny, but as history, that is, as a narrative
that has begun but points always toward the endlessly open. Culture is
an enterprise of mortals, disdaining to protect themselves against
surprise. Living in the strength of their vision, they eschew power and
make joyous play of boundaries.

- Society is a manifestation of power. It is theatrical, having an
established script. Deviations from the script are evident at once.
Deviation is antisocietal and therefore forbidden by society under a
variety of sanctions.


- Deviancy, however, is the very essence of culture. Whoever merely
follows the script, merely repeating the past, is culturally impoverished.

- There are variations in the quality of deviation; not all divergence
from the past is culturally significant. Any attempt to vary from the past
in such a way as to cut the past off, causing it to be forgotten, has little
cultural importance.


- Cultural deviation does not return us to the past, but continues what
was begun and not finished in the past. Societal convention, on the
other hand, requires that a completed past be repeated in the future.
Society has all the seriousness of immortal necessity; culture resounds
with the laughter of unexpected possibility. Society is abstract, culture
concrete.


- Finite games can be played again; they can be played an indefinite
number of times. It is true that the winners of a game are always the
winners of a game played at that particular time, but the validity of their
titles depends on the repeatability of that game.

- As we have seen, because an infinite game cannot be brought to an
end, it cannot be repeated. Unrepeatability is a characteristic of culture
everywhere.


- Just as an infinite game has rules, a culture has a tradition. Since the
rules of play in an infinite game are freely agreed to and freely altered, a
cultural tradition is both adopted and transformed in its adoption.
Properly speaking, a culture does not have a tradition; it is a
tradition.

- It is essential to the identity of a society to forget that it has forgotten
that society is always a species of culture.

- It is essential to the identity of a society to forget that it has forgotten
that society is always a species of culture. Its citizens must find ways ofpersuading themselves that their own particular boundaries have been
imposed on them, and were not freely chosen by them. For example, it
is one thing for persons to choose to be Americans, quite another for
persons to choose to be America. Societal thinking easily permits the
former, never the latter.


- One of the most effective means of self- persuasion available to a
citizenry is the bestowal of property.

- It is therefore essential to the effectiveness of every title that it be
visible and that in its visibility it point back at the contest in which it
was won. The purpose of property is to make our titles visible. Property
is emblematic. It recalls to others those areas in which our victories are
beyond challenge.

- Property may be stolen, but the thief does not therefore own it.
Ownership can never be stolen.

- One reason for the necessity of a society is its role in ascribing and
validating the titles to property. “The great and chief end therefore, of
Mens uniting into Commonwealths, and putting themselves under
Government, is the preservation of their Property; to which in the state
of nature there are many things wanting” (Locke).

- There is no effective pattern of entitlement in a society short of the free agreement
of all opponents that the titles to property are in the hands of the actual
winners.

- a society's rules and regulations are only effective because people have agreed to follow them. The agreement to abide by these rules gives them the force to govern behavior. In other words, people who willingly participate in a society accept the constraints imposed by that society as necessary guidelines for how to act within it. However, if people do not consent to the rules of a society, they will not see them as helpful guidelines but as oppressive and will resist or oppose them.


- Those who challenge the existing pattern of entitlements in a society
do not consider the designated officers of enforcement powerful; they
consider them opponents in a struggle that will determine by its
outcome who is powerful. One does not win by power; one wins to be
powerful.

- The theatricality of property has, in fact, an elaborate structure that
property owners must be at considerable labor to sustain. If property is
to be persuasively emblematic, that is, if it is to draw attention to the
owner’s titles in past victories, a double burden falls on its owners:
First, they must show that the amount of their property corresponds
to the difficulty they were under in winning title to it. Property must be
seen as compensation.
Second, they must show that the type of their property corresponds
to the nature of the competition by which title to it was won. Property
must be seen to be consumed.

- Property is appropriately compensatory whenever owners can show
that what is gained is no more than what was expended in the effort to
acquire it. There must be an equivalency between what the owners have
given of themselves and what they have received from others by way of
their titles.

- Whoever is unable to show a correspondence between wealth and the
risks undergone to acquire it, or the talents spent in its acquisition, will
soon face a challenge over entitlement. The rich are regularly subject to
theft, to taxation, to the expectation that their wealth be shared, as
though what they have is not true compensation and therefore not
completely theirs.

- Property is an attempt to recover the past. It returns one to
precompetitive status. One is compensated for the amount of time spent
(and thus lost) in competition.

- There is a second theatrical requirement that falls on the owners of
property. Once they have drawn attention to what they have lost in
acquiring what they own, they must then consume what they have
gained in a way that recovers the loss.



- The intuitive principle here is that
we cannot be justified in owning what we do not need to use or plan to
use. One does not earn money merely to store it away where it will be
protected from all possible future use.


- Consumption is a kind of activity that is directly opposite to the very
form of engagement by which the title was won. It must be the kind of
activity that can convince all observers that the possesser’s title to it is
no longer in question


- Consumption is an activity so different from gainful labor that it
shows itself in the mode of leisure, even indolence. We display the
success of what we have done by not having to do anything. The more
we use up, therefore, the more we show ourselves to be winners of past
contests.


- If one of the reasons for uniting into commonwealths is the
protection of property, and if property is to be protected less by power
as such than by theater, then societies become acutely dependent on
their artists—what Plato called poietai: the storytellers, the inventors,
sculptors, poets, any original thinkers whatsoever

- While societal thinkers may not overlook the importance of poiesis,
or creative activity, neither may they underestimate its danger, for the
poietai are the ones most likely to remember what has been forgotten—
that society is a species of culture.



- Powerful societies do not silence their poietai in order that they may go to war; they go to
war as a way of silencing their poietai.


- Culture is likely to break out in a society not when its poietai begin
to voice a line contrary to that of the society, but when they begin to
ignore all lines whatsoever and concern themselves with bringing the
audience back into play—not competitive play, but play that affirms
itself as play.


- Art is not art, therefore, except as it leads to an engendering
creativity in its beholders. Whoever takes possession of the objects of art
has not taken possession of the art.


- Since art is never possession, and always possibility, nothing
possessed can have the status of art. If art cannot become property,
property is never art—as property. Property draws attention to titles,
points backward toward a finished time. Art is dramatic, opening
always forward, beginning something that cannot be finished.

- To regard society as a species of culture is not to overthrow or even
alter society, but only to eliminate its perceived necessity. Infinite players
have rules; they just do not forget that rules are an expression of
agreement and not a requirement for agreement.


- For this reason it can be said that where a society is defined by its
boundaries, a culture is defined by its horizon

- A boundary is a phenomenon of opposition. It is the meeting place
of hostile forces. Where nothing opposes there can be no boundary. One
cannot move beyond a boundary without being resisted.

- This is why patriotism—that is, the desire to protect the power in a
society by way of increasing the power of a society—is inherently
belligerent. Since there can be no prizes without a society, no society
without opponents, patriots must create enemies before we can require
protection from them. Patriots can flourish only where boundaries are
well- defined, hostile, and dangerous. The spirit of patriotism is therefore
characteristically associated with the military or other modes of
international conflict.
Because patriotism is the desire to contain all other finite games
within itself—that is, to embrace all horizons within a single boundary
—it is inherently evil.

- A horizon is a phenomenon of vision. One cannot look at the
horizon; it is simply the point beyond which we cannot see. There is
nothing in the horizon itself, however, that limits vision, for the horizon
opens onto all that lies beyond itself. What limits vision is rather the
incompleteness of that vision.


- Every move an infinite player makes is toward the horizon. Every
move made by a finite player is within a boundary. Every moment of an
infinite game therefore presents a new vision, a new range of
possibilities.


- To the degree that the Renaissance was true culture it has not ended.
Anyone may enter into its mode of renewing vision. This does not mean
that we repeat what was done. To enter a culture is not to do what the
others do, but to do whatever one does with the others.



- This is why every new participant in a culture both enters into an
existing context and simultaneously changes that context. Each new
speaker of its language both learns the language and alters it. Each new
adoption of a tradition makes it a new tradition—just as the family into
which a child is born existed prior to that birth, but is nonetheless a new
family after the birth.


- Since a culture is not anything persons do, but anything they do with
each other, we may say that a culture comes into being whenever
persons choose to be a people. It is as a people that they arrange their
rules with each other, their moralities, their modes of communication.


- Societies characteristically separate the ideas from their thinkers, the
poiema from its poietes. A society abstracts its thought and grants
power to certain ideas as though they had an existence of their own
independent from those who think them, even those who first produced
them. In fact, a society is likely to have an idea of itself that no thinker
may challenge or revise.

- For a bounded, metaphysically veiled, and destined society, enemies
are necessary, conflict inevitable, and war likely.


- War is not an act of unchecked ruthlessness but a declared contest
between bounded societies, or states. If a state has no enemies it has no
boundaries. To keep its definitions clear a state must stimulate danger to
itself. Under the constant danger of war the people of a state are far
more attentive and obedient to the finite structures of their society: “just
as the blowing of the winds preserves the sea from the foulness which
would be the result of a prolonged calm, so also corruption in nations
would be the product of prolonged, let alone ‘perpetual’ peace” (Hegel).

- War presents itself as necessary for self- protection, when in fact it is
necessary for self- identification.

- If it is the impulse of a finite player to go against another nation in
war, it is the design of an infinite player to oppose war within a nation.


- Plato suggested that some of the poets be driven out of the Republic
because they had the power to weaken the guardians. Poets can make it
impossible to have a war—unless they tell stories that agree with the
“general line” established by the state. Poets who have no metaphysics,
and therefore no political line, make war impossible because they have
the irresistible ability to show the guardians that what seems necessary
is only possible.

- The danger of the poets, for Plato, is that they can imitate so well
that it is difficult to see what is true and what is merely invented. Since
reality cannot be invented, but only discovered through the exercise of
reason—according to Plato—all poets must be put into the service of
reason. The poets are to surround the citizens of the Republic with such
art as will “lead them unawares from childhood to love of, resemblance
to, and harmony with, the beauty of reason.”
The use of the word “unawares” shows Plato’s intention to keep the
metaphysical veil intact. Those who are being led to reason cannot be
aware of it. They must be led to it without choosing it. Plato asks his
poets not to create, but to deceive.

- When I speak as the genius I am, I speak these words for the first
time. To repeat words is to speak them as though another were saying
them, in which case I am not saying them. To be the genius of my
speech is to be the origin of my words, to say them for the first, and last,
time. Even to repeat my own words is to say them as though I were
another person in another time and place.

- If you do not truly speak the words that reside
entirely in their own sound, neither can you think that which remains
thought or can be translated back into thought. In thinking you cast
thoughts beyond themselves, surrendering them to that which they
cannot be.

- Speaking in purely causal terms, I cannot say I was born; I should
say rather that I have emerged as a phase in the process of reproduction.
A reproduction is a repetition, a recurrence of that which has been.
Birth, on the other hand, in causal terms, is all discontinuity. It has its
beginning in itself, and can be caused by nothing. It makes no sense to
say, “I was reproduced on this date and in this place.” To say “I was
born” is to speak of myself as having an uncaused point of departure
within the realm of the continuous, an absolute beginning not
comprehensible to the explanatory intelligence.

- Theatrically, my birth is an event of plotted repetition. I am born as
another member of my family and my culture. Who I am is a question
already answered by the content and character of a tradition.
Dramatically, my birth is the rupture of that repetitive sequence, an
event certain to change what the past has meant. In this case the
character of a tradition is determined by who I am. Dramatically
speaking, every birth is the birth of genius.

- The drama under way at the time of my birth is moved forward to
new possibilities by the appearance of a new genius within it. It is a
drama, however, already peopled by finite players attempting to forget,
playing for keeps. If I am born into, and add to, the culture of a family, I
am also a product and a citizen of its politics. I first experience the
conflict between the theatrical and the dramatic in the felt pressure to
take up one of the roles prepared for me: eldest son, favorite daughter,
heir to the family’s honor, avenger of its losses.







Take aways:

- “To believe is to know you believe, and to know you believe is not to believe” (Sartre).
It merely means that you should play with your heart fully devoted yet you should also be aware that you're just playing.
