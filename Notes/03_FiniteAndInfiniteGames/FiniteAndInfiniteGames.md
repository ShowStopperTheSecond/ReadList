# Interesting qoutes:

-  A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play.

-  It is an invariable principle of all play, finite and infinite, that whoever plays, plays freely. Whoever must play, cannot play.

-  It is the case that we cannot play if we must play, but it is also the case that we cannot play alone. Thus, in every case, we must find an opponent, and in most cases teammates, who are willing to join in play with us.

-  Because finite players cannot select themselves for play, there is never a time when they cannot be removed from the game, or when the other contestants cannot refuse to play with them.


-  The world is elaborately marked by boundaries of contest, its people finely classified as to their eligibilities.

-  In one respect, but only one, an infinite game is identical to a finite game: Of infinite players we can also say that if they play they play freely; if they must play, they cannot play.

-  Finite games can be played within an infinite game, but an infinite game cannot be played within a finite game. Infinite players regard their wins and losses in whatever finite games they play as but moments in continuing play.

-  If finite games must be externally bounded by time, space, and number, they must also have internal limitations on what the players can do to and with each other. To agree on internal limitations is to establish rules of play.
 
-  The agreement of the players to the applicable rules constitutes the ultimate validation of those rules.

-  Rules are not valid because the Senate passed them, or because heroes once played by them, or because God pronounced them through Moses or Muhammad. They are valid only if and when players freely play by them.

-  There are no rules that require us to obey rules. If there were, there would have to be a rule for those rules, and so on.

-  If the rules of a finite game are unique to that game it is evident that the rules may not change in the course of play—else a different game is being played. It is on this point that we find the most critical distinction between finite and infinite play: The rules of an infinite game must change in the course of play.The rules are changed when the players of an infinite game agree that the play is imperiled by a finite outcome—that is, by the victory of some players and the defeat of others.

-  The rules of an infinite game are changed to prevent anyone from winning the game and to bring as many persons as possible into the play.

-  If the rules of a finite game are the contractual terms by which the players can agree who has won, the rules of an infinite game are the contractual terms by which the players agree to continue playing.

-  The rule- making capacity of infinite players is often challenged by the impingement of powerful boundaries against their play—such as physical exhaustion, or the loss of material resources, or the hostility of nonplayers, or death.

-  The task is to design rules that will allow the players to continue the game by taking these limits into play—even when death is one of the limits. It is in this sense that the game is infinite.

-  Although it may be evident enough in theory that whoever plays a finite game plays freely, it is often the case that finite players will be unaware of this absolute freedom and will come to think that whatever they do they must do

-  Some self- veiling is present in all finite games. Players must intentionally forget the inherently voluntary nature of their play, else all competitive effort will desert them.

-  Dramatically, one chooses to be a mother; theatrically, one takes on the role of mother.

-  One obeys the rules in a finite game in order to play, but playing does not consist only in obeying rules.


-  A finite player is trained not only to anticipate every future possibility, but to control the future, to prevent it from altering the past.

-  Since finite games can be played within an infinite game, infinite players do not eschew the performed roles of finite play. On the contrary, they enter into finite games with all the appropriate energy and self- veiling, but they do so without the seriousness of finite players.

-  Surprise is a crucial element in most finite games. If we are not prepared to meet each of the possible moves of an opponent, our chances of losing are most certainly increased. It is therefore by surprising our opponent that we are most likely to win. Surprise in finite play is the triumph of the past over the future.

-  To be prepared against surprise is to be trained. To be prepared for surprise is to be educated.


-  The infinite player does not expect only to be amused by surprise, but to
be transformed by it, for surprise does not alter some abstract past, but
one’s own personal past.

- Education discovers an increasing richness in the past, because it sees
what is unfinished there. Training regards the past as finished and the
future as to be finished. Education leads toward a continuing self- 
discovery; training leads toward a final self- definition.

- Training repeats a completed past in the future. Education continues
an unfinished past into the future.

- What one wins in a finite game is a title.
A title is the acknowledgment of others that one has been the winner of
a particular game.


- Since titles are timeless, but exist only so far as they are
acknowledged, we must find means to guarantee the memory of them.
The birettas of dead cardinals are suspended from the ceilings of
cathedrals, as it were forever; the numbers of great athletes are “retired”
or withdrawn from all further play; great achievements are carved in
imperishable stone or memorialized by perpetual flames.

- Some titles are inherited, though only when the bloodline or some
other tangible connection with the original winner has been established,
suggesting that the winners have continued to exist in their descendants.


- Death in life is a mode of existence in which one has ceased all play;
there is no further striving for titles. All competitive engagement with
others has been abandoned. For some, though not for all, death in life is
a misfortune, the resigned acceptance of a loser’s status, a refusal to
hold any title up for recognition. For others, however, death in life can
be regarded as an achievement, the result of a spiritual discipline, say,
intended to extinguish all traces of struggle with the world, a liberation
from the need for any title whatsoever. “Die before ye die,” declare the
Sufi mystics.

- Life in death concerns those who are titled and whose titles, since
they are timeless, may not be extinguished by death. Immortality, in this
case, is not a reward but the condition necessary to the possession of
rewards. Victors live forever not because their souls are unaffected by
death but because their titles must not be forgotten.

- Soldiers commonly achieve a life in death. Soldiers fight not to stay
alive but to save the nation. Those who do fight only to protect
themselves are, in fact, considered guilty of the highest military crimes.
Soldiers who die fighting the enemy, however, receive the nation’s
highest reward: They are declared unforgettable. Even unknown soldiers
are memorialized—though their names have been lost, their titles will
not be.

- What the winners of finite games achieve is not properly an afterlife
but an afterworld, not continuing existence but continuing recognition
of their titles.

- A slave can have life only by giving it away. “He who loves his life
loses it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal
life” (Jesus).

-  Death is not, therefore, chosen, but inflicted. It happens to one when the struggle against it fails. Death comes as a judgment, a dishonor, a sign of certain weakness.
 


- If the losers are dead, the dead are also losers.

- Death, for finite players, is abstract, not concrete. It is not the whole
person, but only an abstracted fragment of the whole, that dies in life or
lives in death.
So also is life abstract for finite players. It is not the whole person
who lives. If life is a means to life, we must abstract ourselves, but only
for the sake of winning an abstraction.


- Immortality is therefore the supreme example of the
contradictoriness of finite play: It is a life one cannot live.

- The death of an infinite player is dramatic. It does not mean that the
game comes to an end with death; on the contrary, infinite players offer
their death as a way of continuing the play.


- Infinite players play best when they become least necessary to the
continuation of play. It is for this reason they play as mortals.

- The joyfulness of infinite play, its laughter, lies in learning to start
something we cannot finish.

- Names, like titles, are given. Persons cannot name themselves any
more than they can entitle themselves. However, unlike titles, which are
given for what a person has done, a name is given at birth—at a time
when a person cannot yet have done anything. Titles are given at the
end of play, names at the beginning.

- When a person is known by title, the attention is on a completed
past, on a game already concluded, and not therefore to be played
again. A title effectively takes a person out of play.

- When a person is known only by name, the attention of others is on
an open future. We simply cannot know what to expect. Whenever we
address each other by name we ignore all scripts, and open the
possibility that our relationship will become deeply reciprocal. That I
cannot now predict your future is exactly what makes mine
unpredictable.

- Titles, then, point backward in time. They have their origin in an
unrepeatable past.


- The mode and content of address and the manner of behavior are
recognitions of the areas in which titled persons are no longer in
competition. There are precise ways in which one may no longer
compete with the Dalai Lama or the Heavyweight Champion of the
World. There is no possible action by which one may deprive them of
their titles to contests now in the past. Therefore, insofar as we
recognize their titles we withdraw from any contest with them in those
areas.

- The titled are powerful. Those around them are expected to yield, to
withdraw their opposition, and to conform to their will—in the arena in
which the title was won.

- The exercise of power also presupposes a closed field and finite units
of time. My power is determined by the amount of resistance I can
displace within given spatial and temporal limits.

- To speak meaningfully of a person’s power is to speak of what that
person has already completed in one or another closed field. To see
power is to look backward in time.


- Inasmuch as power is determined by the outcome of a game, one
does not win by being powerful; one wins to be powerful. If one has
sufficient power to win before the game has begun, what follows is not a
game at all.


- Power is bestowed by an audience after the play is complete.


- It seems plainly false to say that power is theatrical.
And yet, the theatrical nature of power seems to be consistent with
the principle arrived at earlier: Whoever must play cannot play. The
intuitive idea in that principle is that no one can engage us competitively
unless we fully cooperate, unless we join the game and join it to win.
Because power is measurable only in comparative—that is, competitive
—terms, it presupposes some kind of cooperation. If we defer to titled
winners, it is only because we regard ourselves as losers. To do so is
freely to take part in the theater of power.


- If I accept death as inevitable, I do not struggle against mortality. I
struggle as a mortal.

- Infinite players do not oppose the actions of others, but initiate actions of their
own in such a way that others will respond by initiating their own.

- A powerful person is one who brings the past to an outcome, settling
all its unresolved issues. A strong person is one who carries the past into
the future, showing that none of its issues is capable of resolution.


- Strength is paradoxical. I am not strong because I can force others to
do what I wish as a result of my play with them, but because I can allow
them to do what they wish in the course of my play with them.

- Power refers to
the freedom persons have within limits, strength to the freedom persons
have with limits.

- Evil is the termination of infinite play. It is infinite play coming to an end in unheard silence.

- Unheard silence does not necessarily mean the death of the player.
Unheard silence is not the loss of the player’s voice, but the loss of
listeners for that voice. It is an evil when the drama of a life does not
continue in others for reason of their deafness or ignorance.

- There are silences that can be heard, even from the dead and from
the severely oppressed. Much is recoverable from an apparently
forgotten past. Sensitive and faithful historians can learn much of what
has been lost, and much therefore that can be continued.

- Evil is not the attempt to eliminate the play of another according to
published and accepted rules, but to eliminate the play of another
regardless of the rules. Evil is not the acquisition of power, but the
expression of power. It is the forced recognition of a title—and therein
lies the contradiction of evil, for recognition cannot be forced. The
Nazis did not compete with the Jews for a title, but demanded
recognition of a title without competition. This could be achieved,
however, only by silencing the Jews, only by hearing nothing from them.
They were to die in silence, along with their culture, without anyone
noticing, not even those who managed the institutions and instruments
of death.


- Evil arises in the honored belief that history can be tidied up, brought to a sensible conclusion. It is evil to act as though the past is bringing us to a specifiable end. It is evil to assume that the past will make sense only if we bring it to an issue we have clearly in view. It is evil for a nation to believe it is “the last, best hope on earth.” It is evil to think history is to end with a return to Zion, or with the classless society, or with the Islamicization of all living infidels.


- Infinite players understand the inescapable likelihood of evil. They
therefore do not attempt to eliminate evil in others, for to do so is the
very impulse of evil itself, and therefore a contradiction. They only
attempt paradoxically to recognize in themselves the evil that takes the
form of attempting to eliminate evil elsewhere.


- One cannot be human by oneself.



- We do not relate to others as the persons we are; we are who we are in relating to others.

- Only that which can change can continue: this is the principle by which infinite
players live.

- Even the open playfulness of children is
exploited through organized athletic, artistic, and educational regimens
as a means of preparing the young for serious adult competition.


- Just as infinite play cannot be contained within finite play, culture
cannot be authentic if held within the boundaries of a society.


- Society and culture are therefore not true opponents of each other.
Rather society is a species of culture that persists in contradicting itself,
a freely organized attempt to conceal the freedom of the organizers and
the organized, an attempt to forget that we have willfully forgotten our
decision to enter this or that contest and to continue in it.

- Heroes of lost battles are almost never memorialized.

- how to contain the serious within the
truly playful; that is, how to keep all our finite games in infinite play.
This challenge is commonly misunderstood as the need to find room
for playfulness within finite games.


- Theycan see that the dream of freedom is universal, that wars are fought to
win it, heroes die to protect it, and songs are written to commemorate
its attainment.

- If we think of society as all that a people does under the veil of
necessity, we must also think of it as a single finite game that includes
any number of smaller games within its boundaries.

- Like a finite game, a society is numerically, spatially, and temporally
limited. Its citizenship is precisely defined, its boundaries are inviolable,
and its past is enshrined.

- It is in the interest of a society therefore to encourage
competition within itself, to establish the largest possible number of
prizes, for the holders of prizes will be those most likely to defend the
society as a whole against its competitors.

- Culture, on the other hand, is an infinite game. Culture has no
boundaries. Anyone can be a participant in a culture—anywhere and at
any time.


- Because culture as such can have no temporal limits, a culture
understands its past not as destiny, but as history, that is, as a narrative
that has begun but points always toward the endlessly open. Culture is
an enterprise of mortals, disdaining to protect themselves against
surprise. Living in the strength of their vision, they eschew power and
make joyous play of boundaries.

- Society is a manifestation of power. It is theatrical, having an
established script. Deviations from the script are evident at once.
Deviation is antisocietal and therefore forbidden by society under a
variety of sanctions.


- Deviancy, however, is the very essence of culture. Whoever merely
follows the script, merely repeating the past, is culturally impoverished.

- There are variations in the quality of deviation; not all divergence
from the past is culturally significant. Any attempt to vary from the past
in such a way as to cut the past off, causing it to be forgotten, has little
cultural importance.


- Cultural deviation does not return us to the past, but continues what
was begun and not finished in the past. Societal convention, on the
other hand, requires that a completed past be repeated in the future.
Society has all the seriousness of immortal necessity; culture resounds
with the laughter of unexpected possibility. Society is abstract, culture
concrete.


- Finite games can be played again; they can be played an indefinite
number of times. It is true that the winners of a game are always the
winners of a game played at that particular time, but the validity of their
titles depends on the repeatability of that game.

- As we have seen, because an infinite game cannot be brought to an
end, it cannot be repeated. Unrepeatability is a characteristic of culture
everywhere.


- Just as an infinite game has rules, a culture has a tradition. Since the
rules of play in an infinite game are freely agreed to and freely altered, a
cultural tradition is both adopted and transformed in its adoption.
Properly speaking, a culture does not have a tradition; it is a
tradition.

- It is essential to the identity of a society to forget that it has forgotten
that society is always a species of culture.

- It is essential to the identity of a society to forget that it has forgotten
that society is always a species of culture. Its citizens must find ways ofpersuading themselves that their own particular boundaries have been
imposed on them, and were not freely chosen by them. For example, it
is one thing for persons to choose to be Americans, quite another for
persons to choose to be America. Societal thinking easily permits the
former, never the latter.


- One of the most effective means of self- persuasion available to a
citizenry is the bestowal of property.

- It is therefore essential to the effectiveness of every title that it be
visible and that in its visibility it point back at the contest in which it
was won. The purpose of property is to make our titles visible. Property
is emblematic. It recalls to others those areas in which our victories are
beyond challenge.

- Property may be stolen, but the thief does not therefore own it.
Ownership can never be stolen. Titles are timeless, and so is the
ownership of property.

- The thief means to win the title, believing that those things to which Iclaim title belong to no one and are there for the taking

- One reason for the necessity of a society is its role in ascribing and
validating the titles to property. “The great and chief end therefore, of
Mens uniting into Commonwealths, and putting themselves under
Government, is the preservation of their Property; to which in the state
of nature there are many things wanting” (Locke).

- There is no effective pattern of entitlement in a society short of the free agreement
of all opponents that the titles to property are in the hands of the actual
winners.

- We do not proceed through a traffic intersection
because the signal changes, but when the signal changes.

- a society's rules and regulations are only effective because people have agreed to follow them. The agreement to abide by these rules gives them the force to govern behavior. In other words, people who willingly participate in a society accept the constraints imposed by that society as necessary guidelines for how to act within it. However, if people do not consent to the rules of a society, they will not see them as helpful guidelines but as oppressive and will resist or oppose them.


- Those who challenge the existing pattern of entitlements in a society
do not consider the designated officers of enforcement powerful; they
consider them opponents in a struggle that will determine by its
outcome who is powerful. One does not win by power; one wins to be
powerful.

- The theatricality of property has, in fact, an elaborate structure that
property owners must be at considerable labor to sustain. If property is
to be persuasively emblematic, that is, if it is to draw attention to the
owner’s titles in past victories, a double burden falls on its owners:
First, they must show that the amount of their property corresponds
to the difficulty they were under in winning title to it. Property must be
seen as compensation.
Second, they must show that the type of their property corresponds
to the nature of the competition by which title to it was won. Property
must be seen to be consumed.

- Property is appropriately compensatory whenever owners can show
that what is gained is no more than what was expended in the effort to
acquire it. There must be an equivalency between what the owners have
given of themselves and what they have received from others by way of
their titles.

- Whoever is unable to show a correspondence between wealth and the
risks undergone to acquire it, or the talents spent in its acquisition, will
soon face a challenge over entitlement. The rich are regularly subject to
theft, to taxation, to the expectation that their wealth be shared, as
though what they have is not true compensation and therefore not
completely theirs.

- Property is an attempt to recover the past. It returns one to
precompetitive status. One is compensated for the amount of time spent
(and thus lost) in competition.

- There is a second theatrical requirement that falls on the owners of
property. Once they have drawn attention to what they have lost in
acquiring what they own, they must then consume what they have
gained in a way that recovers the loss.The intuitive principle here is that
we cannot be justified in owning what we do not need to use or plan to
use.



- The intuitive principle here is that
we cannot be justified in owning what we do not need to use or plan to
use. One does not earn money merely to store it away where it will be
protected from all possible future use.


- Consumption is a kind of activity that is directly opposite to the very
form of engagement by which the title was won. It must be the kind of
activity that can convince all observers that the possesser’s title to it is
no longer in question


- After athletic contests in which major titles have been at stake, it
is common for the audience to lift the winners to their shoulders,
marching them about as if they were helpless—in the sharpest possible
contrast to the physical skill and energy they have just displayed.


- Consumption is an activity so different from gainful labor that it
shows itself in the mode of leisure, even indolence. We display the
success of what we have done by not having to do anything. The more
we use up, therefore, the more we show ourselves to be winners of past
contests.


- If one of the reasons for uniting into commonwealths is the
protection of property, and if property is to be protected less by power
as such than by theater, then societies become acutely dependent on
their artists—what Plato called poietai: the storytellers, the inventors,
sculptors, poets, any original thinkers whatsoever

- But any policy of forceful restraint so extreme that it requires an
officer for each potential criminal is a formula for quick descent into
social chaos.


- If wealth and might are to be performed, great wealth and great
might must be performed brilliantly.

- While societal thinkers may not overlook the importance of poiesis,
or creative activity, neither may they underestimate its danger, for the
poietai are the ones most likely to remember what has been forgotten—
that society is a species of culture.



- The deepest and most consequent struggle of each society is therefore
not with other societies, but with the culture that exists within itself—
the culture that is itself

- Conflict with other societies is, in fact, an
effective way for a society to restrain its own culture

- Powerful societies do not silence their poietai in order that they may go to war; they go to
war as a way of silencing their poietai.


- Culture is likely to break out in a society not when its poietai begin
to voice a line contrary to that of the society, but when they begin to
ignore all lines whatsoever and concern themselves with bringing the
audience back into play—not competitive play, but play that affirms
itself as play.


- Art is not art, therefore, except as it leads to an engendering
creativity in its beholders. Whoever takes possession of the objects of art
has not taken possession of the art.


- Since art is never possession, and always possibility, nothing
possessed can have the status of art. If art cannot become property,
property is never art—as property. Property draws attention to titles,
points backward toward a finished time. Art is dramatic, opening
always forward, beginning something that cannot be finished.

- To regard society as a species of culture is not to overthrow or even
alter society, but only to eliminate its perceived necessity. Infinite players
have rules; they just do not forget that rules are an expression of
agreement and not a requirement for agreement.


- For this reason it can be said that where a society is defined by its
boundaries, a culture is defined by its horizon

- A boundary is a phenomenon of opposition. It is the meeting place
of hostile forces. Where nothing opposes there can be no boundary. One
cannot move beyond a boundary without being resisted.

- This is why patriotism—that is, the desire to protect the power in a
society by way of increasing the power of a society—is inherently
belligerent. Since there can be no prizes without a society, no society
without opponents, patriots must create enemies before we can require
protection from them. Patriots can flourish only where boundaries are
well- defined, hostile, and dangerous. The spirit of patriotism is therefore
characteristically associated with the military or other modes of
international conflict.
Because patriotism is the desire to contain all other finite games
within itself—that is, to embrace all horizons within a single boundary
—it is inherently evil.

- A horizon is a phenomenon of vision. One cannot look at the
horizon; it is simply the point beyond which we cannot see. There is
nothing in the horizon itself, however, that limits vision, for the horizon
opens onto all that lies beyond itself. What limits vision is rather the
incompleteness of that vision.

- We are never somewhere in relation to the horizon since the horizon
moves with our vision. We can only be somewhere by turning away from
the horizon, by replacing vision with opposition, by declaring the place
on which we stand to be timeless—a sacred region, a holy land, a body
of truth, a code of inviolable commandments. To be somewhere is to
absolutize time, space, and number.


- Every move an infinite player makes is toward the horizon. Every
move made by a finite player is within a boundary. Every moment of an
infinite game therefore presents a new vision, a new range of
possibilities.


- To the degree that the Renaissance was true culture it has not ended.
Anyone may enter into its mode of renewing vision. This does not mean
that we repeat what was done. To enter a culture is not to do what the
others do, but to do whatever one does with the others.



- This is why every new participant in a culture both enters into an
existing context and simultaneously changes that context. Each new
speaker of its language both learns the language and alters it. Each new
adoption of a tradition makes it a new tradition—just as the family into
which a child is born existed prior to that birth, but is nonetheless a new
family after the birth.

- Any culture that continues to influence our vision
continues to grow in the very exercise of that influence


- Since a culture is not anything persons do, but anything they do with
each other, we may say that a culture comes into being whenever
persons choose to be a people. It is as a people that they arrange their
rules with each other, their moralities, their modes of communication.


- A culture is sometimes opposed by suppressing its ideas, its works,
even its language. This is a common strategy of a society afraid of the
culture growing within its boundaries. But it is a strategy certain to fail,
because it confuses the creative activity (poiesis) with the product
(poiema) of that activity.



- Societies characteristically separate the ideas from their thinkers, the
poiema from its poietes. A society abstracts its thought and grants
power to certain ideas as though they had an existence of their own
independent from those who think them, even those who first produced
them. In fact, a society is likely to have an idea of itself that no thinker
may challenge or revise.

- A people, as a people, has nothing to defend. In the same way a
people has nothing and no one to attack. One cannot be free by
opposing another. My freedom does not depend on your loss of
freedom. On the contrary, since freedom is never freedom from society,
but freedom for it, my freedom inherently affirms yours.
A people has no enemies.

- For a bounded, metaphysically veiled, and destined society, enemies
are necessary, conflict inevitable, and war likely.


- War is not an act of unchecked ruthlessness but a declared contest
between bounded societies, or states. If a state has no enemies it has no
boundaries. To keep its definitions clear a state must stimulate danger to
itself. Under the constant danger of war the people of a state are far
more attentive and obedient to the finite structures of their society: “just
as the blowing of the winds preserves the sea from the foulness which
would be the result of a prolonged calm, so also corruption in nations
would be the product of prolonged, let alone ‘perpetual’ peace” (Hegel).


- Finite players
go to war against states because they endanger boundaries; infinite
players oppose states because they engender boundaries.


- The strategy of finite players is to kill a state by killing the people
who invented it. Infinite players, however, understanding war to be a
conflict between states, conclude that states can have only states as
enemies; they cannot have persons as enemies. “Sometimes it is possible
to kill a state without killing a single one of its members; and war gives
no right which is not necessary to the gaining of its object”


- For infinite players the chief difficulty with finite players’
commitment to war is not, however, that persons are killed. Indeed,
finite players themselves often genuinely regret this and do as little
killing as possible. The difficulty is that such warfare has in it the
contradiction of all finite play. Winning a war can be as destructive as
losing one, for if boundaries lose their clarity, as they do in a decisive
victory, the state loses its identity


- A war
fought to end all wars, in the strategy of finite play, only breeds
universal warfare. 

- War presents itself as necessary for self- protection, when in fact it is
necessary for self- identification.

- If it is the impulse of a finite player to go against another nation in
war, it is the design of an infinite player to oppose war within a nation.


- Plato suggested that some of the poets be driven out of the Republic
because they had the power to weaken the guardians. Poets can make it
impossible to have a war—unless they tell stories that agree with the
“general line” established by the state. Poets who have no metaphysics,
and therefore no political line, make war impossible because they have
the irresistible ability to show the guardians that what seems necessary
is only possible.

- The danger of the poets, for Plato, is that they can imitate so well
that it is difficult to see what is true and what is merely invented. Since
reality cannot be invented, but only discovered through the exercise of
reason—according to Plato—all poets must be put into the service of
reason. The poets are to surround the citizens of the Republic with such
art as will “lead them unawares from childhood to love of, resemblance
to, and harmony with, the beauty of reason.”
The use of the word “unawares” shows Plato’s intention to keep the
metaphysical veil intact. Those who are being led to reason cannot be
aware of it. They must be led to it without choosing it. Plato asks his
poets not to create, but to deceive.


- Metaphysics is about the real but is abstract. Poetry is the making
(poiesis) of the real and is concrete. Whenever what is made (poiema) is
separated from the maker (poietes), it becomes metaphysical. As it
stands there, and as the voice of the poietes is no longer listened to, the
poiema is an object to be studied, not an act to be learned. One cannot
learn an object, but only the poiesis, or the act of creating objects. To
separate the poiema from poiesis, the created object from the creative
act, is the essence of the theatrical.


- When I speak as the genius I am, I speak these words for the first
time. To repeat words is to speak them as though another were saying
them, in which case I am not saying them. To be the genius of my
speech is to be the origin of my words, to say them for the first, and last,
time. Even to repeat my own words is to say them as though I were
another person in another time and place.

- If you do not truly speak the words that reside
entirely in their own sound, neither can you think that which remains
thought or can be translated back into thought. In thinking you cast
thoughts beyond themselves, surrendering them to that which they
cannot be.


- To speak, or act, or think originally is to erase the boundary of the
self. It is to leave behind the territorial personality. A genius does not
have a mind full of thoughts but is the thinker of thoughts, and is the
center of a field of vision. It is a field of vision, however, that is
recognized as a field of vision only when we see that it includes within
itself the original centers of other fields of vision.


- As the geniuses we are, we do not look but see.

- To look at something is to look at it within its limitations. I look at
what is marked off, at what stands apart from other things. But things
do not have their own limitations.


- I was not looking at the sea gulls as though it was the sea gulls
who happened to be there—I was looking for something to make this
example. I might have seen them as a sign that land is not far, or that
the sea is not far; I could have been looking for a form to reproduce on
a canvas or in a poem. To look at is to look for.


- If to look is to look at what is contained within its limitations, to see
is to see the limitations themselves. Each new school of painting is new
not because it now contains subject matter ignored in earlier work, but
because it sees the limitations previous artists imposed on their subject
matter but could not see themselves.


- When we pass from looking to seeing, we do not therefore lose our
sight of the objects observed. Seeing, in fact, does not disturb our
looking at all. It rather places us in that territory as its genius, aware
that our imagination does not create within its outlines but creates the
outlines themselves.

- To be the genius of myself is not to bring myself into being. As the
origin of myself I am not also the cause of myself, as though I were the
product of my own action. But then neither am I the product of any
other action. My parents may have wanted a child, but they could not
have wanted me.
I am both the outcome of my past and the transformation of my
past.




- Speaking in purely causal terms, I cannot say I was born; I should
say rather that I have emerged as a phase in the process of reproduction.
A reproduction is a repetition, a recurrence of that which has been.
Birth, on the other hand, in causal terms, is all discontinuity. It has its
beginning in itself, and can be caused by nothing. It makes no sense to
say, “I was reproduced on this date and in this place.” To say “I was
born” is to speak of myself as having an uncaused point of departure
within the realm of the continuous, an absolute beginning not
comprehensible to the explanatory intelligence.

- As such a phenomenon birth repeats nothing; it is not the outcome
of the past but the recasting of a drama already under way


- Theatrically, my birth is an event of plotted repetition. I am born as
another member of my family and my culture. Who I am is a question
already answered by the content and character of a tradition.
Dramatically, my birth is the rupture of that repetitive sequence, an
event certain to change what the past has meant. In this case the
character of a tradition is determined by who I am. Dramatically
speaking, every birth is the birth of genius.

- The drama under way at the time of my birth is moved forward to
new possibilities by the appearance of a new genius within it. It is a
drama, however, already peopled by finite players attempting to forget,
playing for keeps. If I am born into, and add to, the culture of a family, I
am also a product and a citizen of its politics. I first experience the
conflict between the theatrical and the dramatic in the felt pressure to
take up one of the roles prepared for me: eldest son, favorite daughter,
heir to the family’s honor, avenger of its losses.


- Not allowing the past to be past may be the primary source for the
seriousness of finite players. Inasmuch as finite play always has its
audience, it is the audience to whom the finite player intends to be
known as winner. The finite player, in other words, must not only have
an audience but must have an audience to convince.


- As with all finite play, an acute contradiction quickly develops at the
heart of this attempt. As finite players we will not enter the game with
sufficient desire to win unless we are ourselves convinced by the very
audience we intend to convince. That is, unless we believe we actually are
the losers the audience sees us to be, we will not have the necessary desire
to win. The more negatively we assess ourselves, the more we strive to
reverse the negative judgment of others. The outcome brings the
contradiction to perfection: by proving to the audience they were
wrong, we prove to ourselves the audience was right.



- Indeed, it is only by remembering what we have forgotten that we can
enter into competition with sufficient intensity to be able to forget we
have forgotten the character of all play: Whoever must play cannot play.


- Whenever we act as the genius of ourselves, it will be in the spirit of
allowing the past to be past. It is the genius in us who is capable of
ridding us of resentment by exercising what Nietzsche called the
“faculty of oblivion,” not as a way of denying the past but as a way of
reshaping it through our own originality. Then we forget that we have
been forgotten by an audience, and remember that we have forgotten
our freedom to play.


- If in the culture into which we are born there are always persons who
will urge us to theatricalize our lives by supplying us with a repeatable
past, there will also be persons (possibly the same ones) in whose
presence we learn to prepare ourselves for surprise. It is in the presence
of such persons that we first recognize ourselves as the geniuses we are.


- When actors bring themselves to tears by
their performance, and not as their performance, they have failed their
craft; they have become theatrically inept. 
This means that we can be moved only by persons who are not what
they are; we can be moved only when we are not who we are, but are
what we cannot be.

- When I am touched, I am touched only as the person I am behind all
the theatrical masks, but at the same time I am changed from within—
and whoever touches me is touched as well. We do not touch by design.
Indeed, all designs are shattered by touching. Whoever touches and
whoever is touched cannot but be surprised. (The unpredictability of
this phenomenon is reflected in our reference to the insane as
“touched.”)
We can be moved only by way of our veils. We are touched through
our veils.


- The character of touching can be seen quite clearly in the way infinite
players understand both healing and sexuality.
If to be touched is to respond from one’s center, it is also to respond
as a whole person. To be whole is to be hale, or healthy. In sum,whoever is touched is healed.

- The finite player’s interest is not in being healed, or made whole, but
in being cured, or made functional. Healing restores me to play, curing
restores me to competition in one or another game.

- To be ill is to be dysfunctional; to be
dysfunctional is to be unable to compete in one’s preferred contests. It is
a kind of death, an inability to acquire titles. The ill become invisible.
Illness always has the smell of death about it: Either it may lead to
death, or it leads to the death of a person as competitor. The dread of
illness is the dread of losing.


- One is never ill in general. One is always ill with relation to some
bounded activity. It is not cancer that makes me ill. It is because I
cannot work, or run, or swallow that I am ill with cancer. The loss of
function, the obstruction of an activity, cannot in itself destroy my
health. I am too heavy to fly by flapping my arms, but I do not for that
reason complain of being sick with weight. However, if I desired to be a
fashion model, a dancer, or a jockey, I would consider excessive weight
to be a kind of disease and would be likely to consult a doctor, a
nutritionist, or another specialist to be cured of it.

- When I am healed I am restored to my center in a way that my
freedom as a person is not compromised by my loss of functions. This
means that the illness need not be eliminated before I can be healed. I
am not free to the degree that I can overcome my infirmities, but only to
the degree that I can put my infirmities into play. I am cured of my
illness; I am healed with my illness.


- Because sexuality is a drama of origins, it gives full expression to the
genius you are and to the genius of others who participate in that
drama. This throws a high challenge before the political ideologue.
Aware that genuine sexual expression is at least as dangerous to society
as genuine artistic expression, the sexual metaphysician can appeal to at
least two powerful solutions. One is to treat sexuality as a process of
reproduction; another is to place it in the area of feeling and behavior.



- Although reproduction is a process that operates by way of our
bodies, it nonetheless operates autonomously. Like every other natural
process it is a phenomenon of causal continuity, having no inherent
beginning or end. Therefore we cannot be said to initiate the process by
any act of our own. We can only be carried along by it, inasmuch as
conception occurs only when all the necessary conditions have been met
by the parenting couple. No one conceives a child; a child is conceived
in the conjunction of sperm and ovum. The mother does not give birth
to a child; the mother is where the birth occurs.


- A society shows its mastery in the management of sexuality not when
it sets out unambiguous standards for sexual behavior or prescribed
attitudes toward sexual feelings, but when it institutionalizes the
emblematic display of sexual conquest. These institutions can be as
varied as burning widows alive on the funeral pyres of their husbands or
requiring the high visibility of a spouse at an elected official’s
inauguration.
Finite sexuality is a form of theater in which the distance between
persons is regularly reduced to zero but in which neither touches the
other.


- Insofar as sexuality is a drama of origin it is original to society and
not derivative of it. It is therefore somewhat misleading to describe
society as a regulator of finite sexual play. It is more the case that finite
sexuality shapes society than is shaped by it



- Only to a limited extent do
we take on the sexual roles assigned us by society. Much more
frequently we enter into societal arrangements by way of sexual roles.
(For example, we are more likely to refer to the king as the father of the
country than we are to refer to the father as king of the family.) While
society does serve a regulatory function, it is probably more correctly
understood as sexuality making use of society to regulate itself.


- This means that society plays little or no role in either causing or
preventing sexual tensions. On the contrary, society absorbs sexual
tensions into all of its structures.


- Society iswhere we prove to parents qua audience that we are not what we
thought they thought we were. Since the emphasis in this relationship is
not on what our parents thought of us but on what we thought they
thought, they become an audience that easily survives their physical
absence or death. Moreover, for the same reason they become an
audience whose definitive approval we can never win


- There is one other way in which society is shaped by the tensions of
finite sexuality: in its orientation toward property. Since sexuality is the
only finite game in which the winner’s prize is the loser, the most
desirable form of property is the publicly acknowledged possession of
another’s person, a relationship to which the possessed must of course
freely consent. All other forms of property are considerably less
desirable, even when they are vast in quantity. The true value of my
property, in fact, varies not with its monetary worth but with its
effectiveness in winning for me the declaration that I am the Master
Player in our game with each other.


- The most serious struggles are those for sexual property. For this
wars are fought, lives are generously risked, great schemes are initiated.
However, who wins empire, fortune, and fame but loses in love has lost
in everything.



-Because finite, or veiled, sexuality is one or another struggle which its
participants mean to win, it is oriented toward moments, outcomes,
final scenes. Like all finite play it proceeds largely by deception. Sexual
desires are usually not directly announced but concealed under a series
of feints, gestures, styles of dress, and showy behavior. Seductions are
staged, scripted, costumed. Certain responses are sought, plots are
developed. In skillful seductions delays are employed, special
circumstances and settings are arranged.



- By contrast, infinite players have no interest in seduction or in
restricting the freedom of another to one’s own boundaries of play.
Infinite players recognize choice in all aspects of sexuality. They may see
in themselves and in others, for example, the infant’s desire to compete
for the mother, but they also see that there is neither physiological norsocietal destiny in sexual patterns. Who chooses to compete with
another can also choose to play with another


- Sexuality is not a bounded phenomenon but a horizonal
phenomenon for infinite players. One can never say, therefore, that an
infinite player is homosexual, or heterosexual, or celibate, or adulterous,
or faithful—because each of these definitions has to do with
boundaries, with circumscribed areas and styles of play. Infinite players
do not play within sexual boundaries, but with sexual boundaries. They
are concerned not with power but with vision. :|
Moving therefore from an original center, the sexual engagements of
infinite players have no standards, no ideals, no marks of success or
failure. Neither orgasm nor conception is a goal in their play, although
either may be part of the play.




Take aways:

- “To believe is to know you believe, and to know you believe is not to believe” (Sartre).
It merely means that you should play with your heart fully devoted yet you should also be aware that you're just playing.
