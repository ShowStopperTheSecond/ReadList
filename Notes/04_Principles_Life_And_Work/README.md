# The Golden Qoutes:
- We are all born with different thinking abilities but we aren’t born with
decision-making skills.
We learn them from our encounters with reality.


- everyone expects the future to be a slightly
modified version of the present, it is usually very different


- I gradually learned that
prices reflect people’s expectations, so they go up when actual results are
better than expected and they go down when they are worse than expected.
And most people tend to be biased by their recent experiences.


- You better make sense of
what happened to other people in other times and other places because if
you don’t you won’t know if these things can happen to you and, if they do,
you won’t know how to deal with them


- In trading you have to be defensive and aggressive at the same
time. If you are not aggressive, you are not going to make money, and if
you are not defensive, you are not going to keep money.


- There are always risks out there that can
hurt you badly, even in the seemingly safest bets, so it’s always best to
assume you’re missing something. This lesson changed my approach to
decision making in ways that will reverberate throughout this book—and to
which
I
attribute
much
of
my
success.
But
I
would
make
many
other
mistakes before I fully changed my behavior.


- While making money was good, having meaningful work and meaningful
relationships was far better.
To me, meaningful work is being on a mission I
become engrossed in, and meaningful relationships are those I have with
people I care deeply about and who care deeply about me.

- Think about it: It’s senseless to have making money as your goal as
money has no intrinsic value—its value comes from what it can buy, and it
can’t buy everything. It’s smarter to start with what you really want, which
are your real goals, and then work back to what you need to attain them.


- In thinking about the
relative
importance
of
great
relationships
and
money,
it
was
clear
that
relationships were more important because there is no amount of money I
would
take
in
exchange
for
a
meaningful
relationship,
because
there
is
nothing I could buy with that money that would be more valuable
